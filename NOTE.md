[] cannot render the new form at the same index page

[] can't turn layout off like Avi did at the video 
    => which leads that I cannot have a json hash
    `only avaliable when I render only json format`
    => also can't consume my url into postman

[] cannot implement the prototype model
    `confused after watching your recorded study group`

[] I don't know how to use json to get another url

[] have wired red error in the console said that rails-uji has already loaded
